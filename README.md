# sample

This is a calendar project completed in 2 weeks for the principles of software engineering class I am currently enrolled in. It is a simple website that incorporates the Google Calendar API to collect and display the logged in user's upcoming events, as well as add new events synced to their Google Calendar.

The backend is written in Java via Servlets, and runs on an Apache Tomcat 9 server. The front end uses a combination of HTML, CSS< and JavaScript.

Deployment notes:
Make sure that the enclosed jar files in the src file are added to the project's classpath and deployment assembly before starting the Tomcat server.
